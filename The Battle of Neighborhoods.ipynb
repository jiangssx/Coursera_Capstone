Both cities are the financial hub of the country, they are in the front row of technology development and both are densely populated. Each city also has its unique traits and features which attracted thousands of tourists around the world. But people need to make choices everyday, and so do we when we travel. If a tourist would like to visit one of the places but have no knowledge and background information about the cities, it will be hard to make the decision. Thus, in this project, I'd like to further explore and compare the differences and similarities of two cities. To provide a more detailed report of the two cities in favor of better decision making.

The datasets will include certain information about the venues around each neighborhoods of the two cities, including but not limited to restaurants, parks, art galleries and etc. After getting the data, we will need to clean and perform some data wraggling according to our needs. We will performe the same analysis on both datasets separately and the results will be used for comparing differences and similiarties. Of course we will choose similar neighborhoods or part of the cities to make the comparison, eventually we will map out the results.
