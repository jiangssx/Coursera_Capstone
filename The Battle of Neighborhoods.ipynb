Both cities are the financial hub of the country, they are in the front row of technology development and both are densely populated. Each city also has its unique traits and features which attracted thousands of tourists around the world. But people need to make choices everyday, and so do we when we travel. If a tourist would like to visit one of the places but have no knowledge and background information about the cities, it will be hard to make the decision. Thus, in this project, I'd like to further explore and compare the differences and similarities of two cities. To provide a more detailed report of the two cities in favor of better decision making. "}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Data Description"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "In order to explore the cities we need to first retrive the neighborhood data using Foursquare API, and on the other hand we will get Toronto's data from the Wikipedia webpage. The datasets will include certain information about the venues around each neighborhoods of the two cities, including but not limited to restaurants, parks, art galleries and etc. After getting the data, we will need to clean and perform some data wraggling according to our needs. We will performe the same analysis on both datasets separately and the results will be used for comparing differences and similiarties. Of course we will choose similar neighborhoods or part of the cities to make the comparison. "}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "For this problem, we will get the services of Foursquare API to explore the data of two cities, in terms of their neighborhoods. The data also include the information about the places around each neighborhood like restaurants, hotels, coffee shops, parks, theaters, art galleries, museums and many more. We selected one Borough from each city to analyze their neighborhoods. Manhattan from New York and Downtown Toronto from Toronto. We will use machine learning technique, \u201cClustering\u201d to segment the neighborhoods with similar objects on the basis of each neighborhood data. These objects will be given priority on the basis of foot traffic (activity) in their respective neighborhoods. This will help to locate the tourist\u2019s areas and hubs, and then we can judge the similarity or dissimilarity between two cities on that basis\n\nFor Downtown Toronto case, we have extracted table of Toronto\u2019s Borough from Wikipedia page. Then we arrange the data according to our requirements. In the arrangement phase, which applied multiple steps including but not limited to, eliminating \u201cNot assigned\u201d values, combine neighborhoods which have same geographical coordinates at each borough and sorted against the concerned borough. For data verification and further exploration, we use Foursquare API to get the coordinates of Downtown Toronto and explore its neighborhoods. The neighborhoods are further characterized as venues and venue categories. For Manhattan, we used a saved data file which is already explored through foursquare API in which we have extracted all the boroughs of New York and then sorted against the concerned borough. Then we explored the Manhattan neighborhoods as venues and venue categories"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
