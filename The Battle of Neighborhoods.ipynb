The city's restaurant market is also a must try when others come to visit, one of the most famous foods is the Pike Place chowder. Thus, to open a restaurant in Seattle is a decent but also hard choice, the kind and the location of the restaurant can decide its fate. Thus, we are going to utilize the Foursquare location data to determine and find some good places for opening a restaurant.

Using the explore function to get the restaurant venue category then clustering the neighborhoods to find out neighborhoods that have the highest spending on restaurants. Datasets that are being used will get updated throughout the project process, so far these are all I need.
